Module.sh has a view different use-cases. The simplest is just about
using it 'somehow'. Therefore, we documented the
[basic usage](/doc/how-to-use-module.sh/) first. For some use cases
is the [usage of the compiler](/doc/how-to-use-the-compiler/)
critical.


For those who do not just want to use modules but [create
them](/doc/how-to-create-a-module/), we added a full section. If you
are just curious how module.sh works, we can recommend reading the
[Understanding Module.sh section](/doc/understanding-module.sh/).
